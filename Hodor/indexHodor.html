      <h2>Hodor Fact</h2>
      <h3>Everybody calls him Hodor, and most of the Stark children actually believe that Hodor is his name, but thatâ€™s not actually the case. It was revealed in the books that Hodorâ€™s real name is actually Walder. He became known as Hodor after his accident, when Hodor was all that he could say, and the new name stuck. It helps that Hodor sounds fairly similar to Walder, and that he still responds to it.</h3>
